This project was made with the intent to start exploring algorithms as a beginner at Python. 
My goal was to visualize a sorting alogrithm without referring to popular alogirhtms like the Quick Sort or the Bubble Sort. 

Progress:
  -At first I had segments of the same code with different element inputs sorting small parts of a default list input 
  -I later generalized this segment to work for any two element inputs for a range k.
  -I found that using the indices of the elements in the given list was a better identifier for the element's position within the list than their actual value.

How it Works: 
  -The algorithm uses a min and max value from a given list input as references to sort elements inbetween
  -The algorithm can sort a list of any given length, as long as all the elements are positive integers
  
Future Plans:
  -I plan on implementing an input system for the algorithm 
  -I was not able to define a function for my sorting algorithm because I did not have the knowledge for it, I plan on containing my algorithm within one defined function to make my code more efficient
